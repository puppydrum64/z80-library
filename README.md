Basic functions for z80 and gbz80 assembly

This is a collection of helpful functions for Z80-based systems. Compatibility with Game Boy and Game Boy Color is not guaranteed; however, effort is being made to create functions that will work with both variants of the Z80 processor. Currently, these files are not guaranteed to work with the eZ80.

Due to the limited memory space of the z80, it is not recommended that all files are included in your program. If you need a file, include it, if you don't, don't. To that end, the files are split up as much as possible so that you don't have to do the cut-&-paste work yourself. Only a few functions will be in each file.
